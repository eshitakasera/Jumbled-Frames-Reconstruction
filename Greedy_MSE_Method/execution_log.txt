Time Complexity 
Note The Greedy Search with Look-Ahead algorithm has a high theoretical time complexity because for
every frame, it iterates through all unused frames to find the best successor, and for each potential
successor, it iterates through the remaining unused frames again.If N is the total number of frames: 
The outer loop runs N times. The search for the best_next_index (inner loop) runs approximately N,
N-1, ..... , 1 times, averaging to O(N^2) complexity for the inner loop over the entire run. The 
look-ahead component adds a second inner loop that also runs O(N) times. The overall complexity of the 
reorder_frames  function is dominated by the nested loops and is approximately O(N^3).
